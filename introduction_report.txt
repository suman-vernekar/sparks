INTRODUCTION

1.1 PROBLEM STATEMENT
Weather prediction and analysis play a crucial role in various sectors including agriculture, transportation, energy, and disaster management. Traditional weather monitoring systems often lack real-time processing capabilities and fail to provide accurate predictions due to the inability to handle large volumes of streaming weather data. There is a growing need for a robust system that can process real-time weather data streams, perform predictive analytics, and provide actionable insights to stakeholders.

1.2 AIM OF THE PROJECT
The aim of this project is to develop a comprehensive weather data analysis system using Apache Spark that can process both batch and streaming weather data, perform real-time analytics, and generate meaningful insights for decision-making. The system focuses on temperature trend analysis, extreme weather event detection, and predictive modeling for weather forecasting.

1.3 SCOPE OF THE PROJECT
This project encompasses the development of a weather analysis pipeline that covers:
- Real-time processing of weather data streams using Spark Streaming
- Batch processing of historical weather data
- Integration with Kafka for data ingestion
- Implementation of machine learning algorithms for weather prediction
- Visualization of weather patterns and trends
- Storage of processed data for future analysis
The system targets meteorological departments, agricultural planners, and research institutions requiring accurate weather insights.

1.4 OBJECTIVES
• Develop a scalable Spark-based architecture for weather data processing
• Implement real-time data ingestion using Kafka messaging system
• Design algorithms for temperature trend analysis and anomaly detection
• Create predictive models for short-term weather forecasting
• Build interactive dashboards for data visualization
• Ensure fault tolerance and high availability of the system
• Optimize data processing pipelines for performance and efficiency

1.5 APPLICATIONS
